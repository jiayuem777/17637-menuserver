### Incremental development using Git (10/10)
### Fulfilling the MenuServe specification (18/20)

-2, You should use external JavaScript files for client-side code, rather than inline script tags.

### Proper Input Validation (17/20)

-3, You should use Django Forms to validate request data, even for Ajax requests.  Note that the validation functionality of a Django Form is independent of its use to render HTML; even if you don’t use the Form to render HTML, you should encapsulate the validation functionality for each request into a single, separate component, a Form.

### Proper Authorization (20/20)
### Tests and Deployment via CI/CD (10/10)
### Appropriate use of web application technologies (20/20)
