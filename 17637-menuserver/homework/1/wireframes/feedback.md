Menu Page

- I am assuming this is for people who have not signed in since there is no way to order a food item\

Order Page

- It would be nice to be able to edit my order, like increase the quantity and delete certain food items before i "submit" my order

- You can integrate the '+' add to cart button into the menu

- From your wireframe, it seems like this user is not logged in - do remember that only users that are logged in can place an order

- I like the concept of a cart with the number of items in it and a total price :)

Menu Management Page

- how would managers add a new food item?

- also, managers have to be logged in to see this page (you have a sign up/ log in prompt, which i dont think should be the case)
